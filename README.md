Flask app to share photos

Users can sign up and create albums to which they can upload photos. The albums can then be shared with other users directly, or to other non-users through specific generated links.

Can be used locally by setting FLASK_ENV to 'development' and FLASK_APP to 'flaskr' and making sure all required modules are installed then just starting up with 'flask run'
