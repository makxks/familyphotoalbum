# Family Photo Album
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Flask app to share photo albums - primarily for sharing with family.
  
Inspiredby my own situation of living away from most of my family and being unable to visit for an extended period due to COVID. My final project is a flask web app to easily share photos with other users, and non-users of the site.

Users can sign up and create albums to which they can upload photos. The albums can then be shared with other users directly, or to other non-users through specific generated links.

Can be used locally by setting FLASK_ENV to 'development' and FLASK_APP to 'flaskr' and making sure all required modules are installed then just starting up with 'flask run'
